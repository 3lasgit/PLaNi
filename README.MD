### Welcome 👋
This is a streamlit application that automates sizing and Planning generation. The project lies on this formula:  
PLaNi = forecasting models 📈 + combinatorial optimization 🧮 + streamlit app 🌐 interface.   
Each one is in a folder indicated by the corresponding tag. You can find the part you want in the architecture of the project which is as follows :

- application  
  - data  
  - models  
  - pages 🌐  
    - 1_🙋‍♂️_Présence.py  
    - 2_🧮_Recommandation.py  
    - 3_📞📧_Résultat.py

I ran and created this project autonomously during my internship at Air Liquide.   

All the greetings return to the All-Mighty. Thanks to them for welcoming and supporting me.
