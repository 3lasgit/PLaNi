Welcome, 
This is a streamlit application that does what the description explains.

You can find in application the .py to generate the streamlit app. In the other folders are the notebooks to generate the forecasting models by LGBM method.
I ran and created this project all by myself during my internship at Air Liquide. Thanks to them for welcoming and supporting me.

All the greetings return to the All-Mighty.
