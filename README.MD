### Welcome 👋
This is a streamlit application that automates sizing and Planning generation. The project lies on this formula: PLaNi = forecasting models (FC) + combinatorial optimization (CO) + streamlit app (SA) interface.   
Each one is in a folder indicated by the corresponding tag. You can find the part you want in the architecture of the project which is as follows :  

PLaNi  
-application (SA)  
  -data  
  -models  
  -pages  
    -1_🙋‍♂️_Présence.py  
    -2_🧮_Recommandation.py  
    -3_📞📧_Résultat.py  
  -main.py  
  -tools.py (CO)  
  -tools_new.py (CO)  
-csv_data_builder  
  -cons_data.ipynb  
-models_builders (FC)  
  -gives.py  
  -lgbm_reg_D_mail_invoicing.pkl  
  -mail_contact_D_lgbm.ipynb  
  -mail_invoicing_D_lgbm.ipynb  
  -volume_lgbmC_H.ipynb  
  -volume_lgbm_H_avec_feat_H.ipynb  
-some dependencies management files and others: poetry.lock, pyproject.toml  

In the other folders are the notebooks to generate the forecasting models by LGBM method.  
I ran and created this project autonomously during my internship at Air Liquide.   

All the greetings return to the All-Mighty. Thanks to them for welcoming and supporting me.
